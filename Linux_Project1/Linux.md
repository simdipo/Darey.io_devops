## Introduction to Linux and Basic Commands
Linux is a family of open-source Unix operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. They include Ubuntu, Fedora,
Debian, openSUSE, and Red Hat. Using Linux to manage a Virtual Private Server (VPS) is common practice.
When operating Linux, you need to use a shell - a program that gives you access to the operating system's services. Most
Linux distributions use a graphical user interface (GUI), making them beginner-friendly.

However, we recommend utilizing the command-line interface (CLI) because it's quicker and offers more control. Tasks
that require multiple steps on the GUI can be done in a matter of seconds by entering commands into the CLI.
So if you want to use Linux, learning the common utilities or commands will go a long way.

## What Is a Linux Command?
A Linux command is a program or utility that runs on the CLI - a console that interacts with the system via texts and
processes. It's.similar to the Command Prompt application in Windows.
Linux commands are executed on Terminal by pressing Enter at the end of the line. You can run commands to perform
various tasks, from package installation to user management and file manipulation.

## File Permissions and Ownership
### 21. chmod command:
chmod is a common command that modifies a file or directory's read, write, and execute permissions. In Linux, each file is
associated with three user classes - owner, group member, and others.
![chmod directory](Linux_Images/chmod.png)

### 22. chown command:
The chown command lets you change the ownership of a file, directory, or symbolic link to a specified username.
![chown directory](Linux_Images/chown.png)

#### 23. jobs command:
A job is a process that the shell starts. The jobs command will display all the running processes along with their statuses.
Remember that this command is only available in csh, bash, tcsh, and ksh shells.
![jobs directory](Linux_Images/jobs.png)
### 24. kill command:
Use the kill command to terminate an unresponsive program manually. It will signal misbehaving applications and
instruct them to close their processes.
![kill directory](Linux_Images/kill.png)

### 25.ping command:
The ping command is one of the most used basic Linux commands for checking whether a network or a server is
reachable. In addition, it is used to troubleshoot various connectivity issues.
![ping directory](Linux_Images/ping.png)
### 26. wget command:
The Linux command line lets you download files from the internet using the wget command. It works in the background
without hindering other running processes.
![wget directory](Linux_Images/wget.png)
### 27. uname command:
The uname or unix name.command will print detailed information about your Linux system and hardware. 
![uname directory](Linux_Images/uname.png)
### 29.history command:
With history, the system will list up to 500 previously executed commands, allowing you to reuse them without re-
entering. Keep in mind that only users with sudo privileges can execute this command. How this utility runs also depends
on which Linux shell you use
![history directory](Linux_Images/history.png)
### 30. man command:
The man command provides a user manuald of any commands or utilitigs.
![man directory](Linux_Images/man.png)
### 31. echo command:
The echo command is a built-in utility that displays a line of text or string using th√© standard output. 
![echo directory](Linux_Images/echo.png)
### 32. zip, unzip commands:
Use the zip command to compress your files into a ZIP file, a universal format commonly used on Linux. It can
automatically choose the best compression ratio.
![zip, unzip directory](Linux_Images/zip.png)
### 33. hostname command:
Run the hostname command to know the system's hostname. You can execute it with or without an option.
![hostname directory](Linux_Images/hostname.png)
### 34. useradd, userdel commands:
Linux is a multi-user system, meaning more than one'person can use it simultaneously. useradd is used to create
account, while the passwd command allows you to add a password. Only those with root privileges or sudo can
useradd command.
![useradd directory](Linux_Images/useradd.png)
### 35. apt-get command:
apt-get is a command line tool for handling Advanced Package Tool (APT) libraries in Linux. It lets you retrieve
information and bundles from authenticated sources to manage, update, remove, and install software and its
dependencies.
Running the apt-get command requires you

### 36. nano, vi, jed commands:
Linux allows users to edit and manage files via a text editor, such as hano, Vi, or jed. nano and vid come with the opera
system, while jed has to be installed.
The nano command denotes keywords and can work with most languages. To use it, enter the following 
![editor directory](Linux_Images/editor.png)
### 37. alias, unalias commands:
alias allows you to create a shortcut with the same functionality as a command, file name, or text. When exe
instructs the shellto replace one string with another.
![alias directory](Linux_Images/alias.png)
### 38. su command:
The switch user or su command allows you to run a program as a different user. It changes the administrative ac
the current log-in session. This command is especially beneficial for accessing the system through SSH or using t
display manager when the root user is unavailable

### 39. htop command:
The htop command is an inter active program that monitors system resources and server processes in real time. It
available on most Linux distributions, and you can install it using the default package manager.
![htop directory](Linux_Images/htop.png)
### 40. ps command:
The process status or ps command produces a snapshot of all running processes in your system.
